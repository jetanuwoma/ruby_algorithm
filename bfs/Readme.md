#BFS

Breadth-first search is a graph transversal mechanism in which neighboring nodes are examined or evaluated first before moving to the next level, it is a level by level exploration. This helps to ensure that the number of links found in the resulting chain is always minimum, hence we always get the shortest possible path from node A to node B. Examples of where it can be used:

 - Minimum Spanning Tree or shortest path.
 - Peer to peer networking
 - Crawler for search engine
 - Social network websites
