## Heap Sort
 is a comparison-based algorithm that uses a heap data structure to sort its elements,
it can be used in sorting an array, it divides its elements into a sorted and an unsorted region, we
then first find the maximum element and place it at the end of the sorted region. We repeat the
same process for the remaining elements. Worst case is  O(n log n )

# Advatages
 - The Heap sort algorithm is very efficient. While other sorting algorithms may grow exponentially slower as the number of items to sort increase, the time required to perform Heap sort increases logarithmically. the performance of Heap sort is optimal meaning no other Algorithm can perform better

 - Its memory efficient since it can be implemented as an in-place sorting algorithm. This means that its memory usage is minimal because apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list of items to be sorted, it needs no additional memory space to work.
